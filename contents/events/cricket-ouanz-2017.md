OIS lost against OUANZ in the inaugral Harbhajan-Ronchi trophy. Here's the match report from the captain, Bharat:
 
"Unfortunately we lost a hard-fought inaugural Harbhajan-Ronchi trophy match. Everyone showed some serious grit and determination to run them close after a poor start by us gave them the advantage. Some top class lower order batting, opening bowling, and best of all, fielding, almost hauled us onto a winning position but in the end our top order batting let us down against a strong Aus/NZ bowling unit."

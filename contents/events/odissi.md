Oxford India Society, in collaboration with Oxford Odissi Centre, is delighted to invite you to an evening of enthralling Indian classical dance performances. A celebration of graceful movement and artistic expression, the festival promises to be enchanting and inspiring in equal measure.

So join us on this journey where we reinterpret themes of freedom and happiness through four glorious dance forms: Mohiniyattam, Kathak, Bharatnatyam, and Odissi.

The festival will feature India's most renowned dancer and choreographer, Padma Shri Guru Ileana Citaristi followed by a troupe of young elegant artistes.

Lakshmi is the story of a beautiful 14 year old girl whose life takes a tragic turn. She is snatched from her family in the village and sold to a brothel in the city. Lakshmi is thrown into this horrific, inhuman, world run by the ruthless Reddy brothers. Quietly rebellious, Lakshmiâ€™s efforts to escape result in her being brutally beaten. She manages to survive her hellacious predicament with the help of the other girls and her own will to never give in. Finally she is rescued in a sting operation by a government organization. Against all odds, the traumatized and broken child-woman shows courage where everybody else fails. Resisting all pressure - violent threats, coercion and bribes, she stands up in court and in a historic landmark case succeeds in putting the traffickers behind bars. Based on true events, Lakshmi is a story of heroism and untold courage.

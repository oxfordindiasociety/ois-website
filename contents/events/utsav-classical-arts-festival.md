Oxford India Performing Arts Centre presents [Utsav 2017] (https://www.facebook.com/events/818802854925306/) : a showcase of the Indian Classical Arts (with elements of Bollywood and fusion to add a bit of a twist)!

Come along for a fascinating evening of performances by students of the Classical Arts in Oxford! For those with minimal experience of the Indian Classical Arts, this is the ultimate opportunity to get a good glimpse of a completely different side of culture we don't see very often! This year we will be featuring dance styles such as Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi and Kuchipudi as well as Hindustani Classical and Carnatic Classical music forms!

We are also privileged to have the stunning Odissi dancers, Dr. Elena Catalano and Katie Ryan perform with us on our stage this year!

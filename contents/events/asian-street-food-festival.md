With the launch of Kabaddi this year, we want to pay homage to the Asian continent that has pioneered this game over the last few decades. We could think of no better way to appreciate these countries than to host an event featuring the distinctive street food that characterise these various nations, including India, Iran, South Korea, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Pakistan etc.

This event is open to everyone with an interest in food and where it comes from. We will also be a screening a hit bollywood movie.

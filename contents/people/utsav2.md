Utsav is a 2nd Year undergraduate reading Mathematics and Computer Science at Balliol College. Translation: He shares a love-hate relationship with his laptop most of the time, though he does resolve differences right before a problem sheet is due. He comes to this position with great expectations to match - after all, what else can be expected of a Gujju from Bombay?
